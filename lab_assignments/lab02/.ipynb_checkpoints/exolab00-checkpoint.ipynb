This is the an example ExoStat Lab and the purpose of the labs is to give you hands-on experience using the skills from the main YData course (S&DS 123/523) while working within a particular domain.  For this seminar, the focus is on detecting and characterizing exoplanets!\n",

    "- Some questions of this lab are the same as the Practice 01 question 1 found on the main [YData website](http://ydata123.org/sp19/) -- it explains the basic setup of a Jupyter Notebook.  I highly recommend that you work on the Practice exercises each week, and especially the rest of Practice 01.  \n",

    "- Collaborating on the ExoStat Labs is encouraged. If you get stuck for a while on a question, feel free to ask a neighbor or come to the instructor's or TF's office hours for additional help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) Please don't just share answers, though.\n",

And we thought where would be a better place to confirm his findings than on the Moon. And so we thought we'd try it here for you. The feather happens to be, appropriately, a falcon feather for our Falcon. And I'll drop the two of them here and, hopefully, they'll hit the ground at the same time. \n",
